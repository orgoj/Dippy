# Local Man Page Command Classification

Grouping commands into handler-style families.

Families:
- **safe**: No handler needed, SIMPLE_SAFE material
- **done**: Already handled (SIMPLE_SAFE, WRAPPER_COMMANDS, or has handler)
- **n/a**: Not applicable
- **delegate**: Wraps/executes other commands, extract inner command
- **subcommand**: Multi-level CLI, check subcommand against safe/unsafe lists
- **flag-check**: Safe by default, specific flags make it unsafe
- **arg-count**: Safety depends on argument count
- **ask**: Always requires confirmation, no safe mode
